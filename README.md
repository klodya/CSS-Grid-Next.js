# CSS-Grid-Next.js - Demo site
This project was built as part of a talk I did for Women Who Code in Edinburgh. 
I thought it would be good to showcase some of the nice things you can do with Next.js and CSS Grid combined.

It was built to go alongside the talk and is a work in progress and I hope to have time to keep adding and building this site.
